2. Summary  
    It's big adventure and great challenge for me. It's very important for me. My current work is not in IT. I have been working as an civil engineer for 10 years. And six month ago I decided to change my life. I want to do what is relevant today and will be relevant tomorrow. I want to do something useful and needful. I want to work hard and get appropriate feedback. I want to be developer. And EPAM is the best that can happen to me. Maybe it will be difficult. But, as one famous governor said:  
    >No pain - no gain!
